VLSI design verification has been the hot topic in semiconductor in the past decade. As the physical limits of IC fabrication has been pushed to the limits, the complexity of the underlying design is ever increasing. Which results in 2X difficulty in verifying and proving the design and architecture. I hope this website will help you with some quick turn-key solutions to not-so-common DV tasks. 
Cheers!

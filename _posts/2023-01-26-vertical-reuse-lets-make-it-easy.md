Jotting down some of the guidelines that shall be followed while building block level testbenches [^footnote]. 

## Sequences
- The default configuration generated by a sequence should fall in the legal space. Do not enforce the sequence API user to add constraints. 
- Use layered sequences whenever required. 
- Use `config_db` effectively to make the sequence adaptable to different levels. (Eg, do not make assignments to configurations with in the sequence, instead grab it from `config_db`)

## Components

Active/Passive components' behavior in each mode needs to be carefully orchestrated. 
- All the components in the testbench needs to take care of the value of its `is_active`  (eg, connection of `sequencer` and `driver` needs to be guarded under `is_active`)
- Active components should not
  - Update any members of `cfg`
  - dump important message that could uncover some difficult-to-debug errors
  - collect coverage
  - send information to scoreboard
  - implement any checks
  - influence test ending mechanism
